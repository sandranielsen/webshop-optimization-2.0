              My Name is Sandra Mago. I'm the person behind the creative
              universe - MagoMade - which I started back in the summer of 2021.
              However I have been crocheting since the first corona-lockdown in
              2020. I have an education in multimedia design and communication
              and I'm currently finishing my bachelors degree in web
              developement. The last year MagoMade has simply been a little side
              project but as I had to do an internship on my last semester and
              here got the opportunity to be an intern in my own company, it
              came very naturally that I started putting my time and effort into
              my small and growing business. The dream is to make my hobby a
              career one day.
            </p>
            <p className="font-light text-base">
              MagoMade takes inspiration from my Filipino roots, which is also
              where the name Mago originates from. Although I grew up in
              Denmark, Filipino culture has alway been a big part of my everyday
              life thanks to my mama, who was born and raised in the festive and
              culturally rich country. My brand is greatly based on my love for
              flashy and wild colours which can be seen in the majority of my
              creations. This love arose all the way back from visits to my
              family in the Philippines as a child - visits to my lola's
              (grandmother in Cebuano) colorful home with a flashy pink facade,
              turquoise garden chairs and the azure sea almost right in the
              backyard.

              I primarily make crochet patterns and guides with the goal of
              making crochet easier and more accessible to everyone - whether
              you are a complete beginner or experienced. My recipes are modern
              and contemporary. It is clear that many of the crochet patterns
              available online today are aimed at an older audience, and there
              is a lack of designs and patterns aimed at a younger generation.
              My goal is to fill this gap.
            </p>
            <p className="font-light text-base">
              It's important to me that my recipes and guides are easy to
              understand and are described in detail. Crochet patterns can often
              be a struggle to read and understand with all the abbreviations
              and diagrams that they can contain, especially as a beginner.
              Therefore, my recipes contain both a detailed and a simplified
              guide or step-by-step pictures so that everyone can follow along.
            </p>
            <p className="font-light text-base">
              In addition to being contemporary, my recipes are also simple and
              easily adaptable in the sense that you can use the recipe to
              create a piece of clothing in exactly the colors you like, in a
              carefully selected yarn type and in a adaptable pattern in the
              hopes that it can give the clothes a longer life and break with
              the use-and-throw-away culture. At the same time, my recipes are
              easy and easy to understand, which means that you can enjoy the
              process of crocheting your own clothes without major problems.
